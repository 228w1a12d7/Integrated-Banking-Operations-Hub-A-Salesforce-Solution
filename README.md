# Integrated Banking Operations Hub: A Salesforce Solution


### Problem Statement

A financial institution is struggling with disconnected, department-specific systems. Their loan officers use one system, wealth advisors use spreadsheets, and the compliance team uses a manual, paper-based process. This leads to:

- **Fragmented Client Data:** No single source of truth for a client's financial history, making it impossible to get a complete 360-degree view.
- **Operational Inefficiency:** Manual data entry across multiple systems leads to high operational costs and a high risk of errors.
- **Compliance Risk:** Without a centralized system, the bank struggles to enforce regulatory compliance and track all risk events, exposing them to potential fines and legal issues.

The goal is to build a single, unified **Salesforce-based Integrated Banking Operations Hub** that connects all these functions. This solution will not only streamline operations but also provide a secure and compliant platform for managing all client relationships.

### Key Features and Use Cases

This project will be a masterclass in Salesforce development, covering all the topics from your training calendar. It's unique because it integrates multiple business processes into a single solution.

**1. Loan Management Module**
- **Use Case:** Digitize the loan application, approval, and repayment process.
- **Key Features:** Automated risk scoring, multi-step approval process, and a customer portal for applicants.

**2. Wealth & Portfolio Management Module**

### Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

**1. Requirement Gathering**
- **What we'll build:** A single platform to manage client records, loan applications, investment portfolios, and compliance regulations.
- **Key features:** We will need to build custom objects for each module and use automation to connect them.

**2. Stakeholder Analysis**
- **Loan Officers:** They will use the **Loan Management Module** to process applications.
- **Wealth Advisors:** They will use the **Wealth Management Module** to manage client portfolios.
- **Compliance Officers:** They will use the **Compliance Module** to enforce regulations across the entire system.
- **Management:** They will get a complete picture of the bank's operations, financial performance, and risk exposure.

**3. Business Process Mapping**
- **Proposed Process:** A client's information is entered once. A loan officer can open a loan application for them. A wealth advisor can create an investment portfolio. All these actions are tracked by the compliance module, ensuring every step is secure and compliant.

**4. Industry-specific Use Case Analysis**
- This project is highly innovative because it addresses the problem of **data silos** in financial institutions. Instead of building three separate projects, you're building a single integrated platform, which is what real companies do.

**5. AppExchange Exploration**
- We'll explore AppExchange for tools like **DocuSign** for e-signatures, **DocGen** for document generation, and a free API to get dummy **stock prices**.

### How this Project Covers Every Topic

- **Admin:** You'll build multiple objects, implement **Approval Processes** for loans, and create **Validation Rules** for compliance.
- **Developer:** You'll use an **Apex Trigger** to calculate portfolio value, **Batch Apex** to update market data, and **Scheduled Apex** to send monthly compliance reports.
- **UI (LWC):** You'll build a custom **LWC** dashboard for each module (loan, wealth, compliance) to give a personalized experience.
- **Integration:** You'll use **REST callouts** and **Named Credentials** to get real-time stock prices.
